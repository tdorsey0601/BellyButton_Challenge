# BellyButton_Challenge

In this repository, it contains a Javascript file as well as a HTML file in the root directory. The repository also contains the dataset as a json file. The charts.js makes a d3 call to retrieve the dataset and create graphs with Plotly: a bar graph and a bubble chart of the samples in the test subject's navel. It also fills out a dropdown menu of all the test subjects and populates a panel with the currently displayed test subject. Upon changing the dropdown, the browser updates the panel information and visualizations.
